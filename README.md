# codewars-solutions-python
These are my solutions for various codewars challenges aka 'kata'. 'Kyu' referrs to difficulty. The lower kyu number, the more difficult.

If you want to try cw yourself, you can use my referral link. www.codewars.com/r/rDj0mQ.

Please note some of the solutions are good, some are bad and some are purposelly silly to entertain the codewars community.

You shouldn't use these solutions to pass the challenges, they are meant to inspire and give you a possible way of thinking about it to solve it yourself.
